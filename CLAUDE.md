# Codebase Cognitive Memory

A graph-based memory layer for coding agents. `spec.md` is the contract;
`ROADMAP.md` tracks milestone status (check it before doing anything — it's
the source of truth, not this file's memory of past sessions).

## Rules (non-negotiable — see AGENT_HARNESS.md for the full rationale)

- Stack is locked: pnpm + TypeScript workspaces, Postgres + pgvector +
  pg_trgm, ts-morph for TS/JS structural extraction. Don't introduce a
  different one without flagging it explicitly first.
- Never check a ROADMAP.md milestone box without having actually run its
  tests in this session and seen them pass (unit always; integration tests
  need `DATABASE_URL`, set automatically by the SessionStart hook —
  `scripts/setup-dev-db.sh` if you need to set it up by hand).
- One milestone per run/PR. Don't blend milestones into one diff.
- `spec.md`'s already-made decisions (§3.2 node identity, §3.3 confidence
  vs weight, §7 promotion thresholds, §10 traversal batching) are final —
  extend them, don't relitigate them. If one genuinely blocks a milestone,
  say so in the commit/PR description instead of silently overriding it.

## Picking up work

Run the `/next-milestone` skill — it finds the next unchecked milestone,
implements it, tests it for real, opens a PR, and subscribes to that PR's
activity so CI failures and review comments come back automatically.

## Repo/branch

`cuonghuunguyen/claude-notebook`. Milestone work happens on branches cut
from `claude/codebase-cognitive-memory-spec-t7nnx0`, PR'd back into it.
